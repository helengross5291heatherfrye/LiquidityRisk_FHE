# LiquidityRisk_FHE

A privacy-preserving framework for confidential analysis of financial market liquidity risk using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).  
The system enables regulators to perform liquidity risk simulations and systemic stability assessments across encrypted balance sheet data from multiple institutions — without ever accessing the underlying sensitive financial information.

---

## Introduction

Modern financial supervision requires cross-institutional data sharing and systemic risk evaluation. However, such collaboration often conflicts with the confidentiality obligations of individual institutions.  
Balance sheet data, funding positions, and liquidity buffers contain proprietary and sensitive information that cannot be exposed, even to regulators or central clearing authorities.

**LiquidityRisk_FHE** introduces a secure computational layer that enables risk analytics directly on encrypted datasets.  
Regulators can aggregate, simulate, and assess liquidity risk in real time while financial institutions maintain absolute data privacy.

## Why Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows arithmetic computations to be performed on ciphertexts — producing encrypted results that, when decrypted, match the outcome of the same computation on plaintext.  
This cryptographic property is particularly powerful in the financial domain, where raw data exposure could lead to competitive disadvantages or regulatory breaches.

### How FHE Solves the Liquidity Risk Problem

- **Confidential Cross-Bank Computation**: Regulators can analyze liquidity coverage ratios (LCR) and stress-test parameters across multiple banks without viewing their raw balance sheets.  
- **Trustless Collaboration**: Institutions contribute encrypted datasets that can be jointly analyzed in a mathematically verifiable yet confidential way.  
- **Secure Systemic Monitoring**: System-level liquidity stress simulations are run under encryption, ensuring sensitive positions remain private.  
- **Compliance and Integrity**: Meets regulatory and legal data protection requirements while enhancing transparency of the analytical process.

## Key Features

### 1. Encrypted Data Contribution
- Each participating institution encrypts its financial balance sheet data using an FHE scheme.  
- Encryption occurs locally; only ciphertexts are uploaded.  
- No institution ever exposes its actual financial statements.

### 2. FHE-Based Risk Computation
- Liquidity metrics such as LCR, NSFR, and cash-flow mismatch are computed directly on encrypted inputs.  
- Multi-period simulations and shock propagation models operate fully under encryption.  
- Results remain encrypted until decrypted by authorized regulators.

### 3. Aggregated Market Indicators
- Encrypted outputs from multiple institutions are combined to assess systemic liquidity patterns.  
- The cloud infrastructure performs aggregation without decryption.  
- Only final decryption keys reveal global, anonymized indicators.

### 4. Regulatory Visualization Interface
- Encrypted computation results are visualized as high-level dashboards once decrypted by the supervisory authority.  
- Risk heatmaps and liquidity stress signals are generated from aggregated encrypted data.

## Technical Design

### Encryption Layer
- Based on CKKS scheme for approximate arithmetic on real-valued financial data.  
- Supports vectorized encrypted operations (addition, multiplication, scaling).  
- Enables simulation of liquidity flows under encrypted conditions.

### Compute Layer
- Distributed cloud nodes execute encrypted liquidity stress tests.  
- Supports Monte Carlo–style scenario modeling for multiple asset-liability configurations.  
- Optimized batching to handle high-dimensional institutional datasets.

### Decryption Layer
- Only authorized regulator nodes can decrypt aggregate indicators.  
- Institutional-level details remain permanently concealed.  
- Results focus on system-level risk, not individual exposure.
